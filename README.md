# Horse Racing 🏇

## About 🔎

Horse Racing is an app where users can simulate randomly generated competitions. Users can generate 20 horses in a completely random manner. With these randomly created horses, users can create rounds where horses compete. Users can watch the simulation of the race and dynamically start and stop it.

## What is special about this app? 💎

- Modularity is highly considered in this app. Components are broken down into smaller code pieces.
- The do not repeat yourself principle is strongly emphasized to avoid code duplication.
- The software design and implementation are maintainable. New features can be added simply, or existing features can be changed instantaneously.

## Implementation 🛠️

### Generating Horses

Users can generate 20 completely different horses by randomly mixing 40 adjectives, 40 nouns, and 40 colors. The uniqueness of all horse information is guaranteed.
